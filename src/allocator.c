/*
 * Author: Mitchell Lord
 *
 * My custom implementation of malloc and free from stdlib.h.
 * Allocates memory by calling sbrk() to grow the heap.
 *
 * Uses a singly linked list of Block structs to track allocated and free memory blocks.
 * Each block contains metadata (size, status, next pointer) followed by useable memory.
 *
 * Free blocks are reused when possible, and contigous memory blocks are coalesced to
 * reduce fragmentation and manage memory more efficiently.

 * Represents a memory block in the allocator.
 * Each allocated block contains metadata followed by usable memory.
 *
 * Fields:
 *   size - number of bytes of usable memory in the block.
 *   free - 1 if the block is free, 0 if it is allocated.
 *   next - pointer to the next Block in the linked list.
